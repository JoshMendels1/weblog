I've always wanted a little corner of the internet. I liked instagram back in the day (before reels, before the For You feeds, when it was just you and your friends and a few memes). I like the *idea* of twitter, but even that has an algorithm, and maybe just a bit too much reach. A first post is always daunting, because, what do you even say? What do people want to hear? What if you say it wrong?

That's what this site is for. No one knows about it at the moment, so I can just yap away. Its my own corner of the internet, and it's almost... private? People will only find it if they google my name, or if I show it to them. That's the way I like it right now. And who knows, if I stick with it, maybe it'll be cool to look back on at some point!

I was inspired by others, like [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) and [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/).

Anyway, enjoy my ramblings, hot takes, AI and coding ramblings, and maybe even some music, if I'm ever proud enough to post something I make.

**Welcome to my weblog.**
