description: "Getting started with a simple static blog"
---

This is my first blog post! I'm using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build a simple, fast static site.

## Why 11ty?

- Dead simple
- Markdown support out of the box
- No client-side JavaScript required
- Easy to extend

## What I'm Planning

I want to write about:

- Technical discoveries
- Links to interesting articles
- Project updates

## How It Works

Each post is just a markdown file with some frontmatter. Here's what this post looks like:

```markdown
---
layout: post.njk
title: "Welcome to My Blog"
date: 2024-12-15
---

Content goes here...
```

You can include code blocks, links, images, and all the usual markdown features.
